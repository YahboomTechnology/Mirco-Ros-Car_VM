# ESP32 Micro ROS Robot Car(Virtual Machine)
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Mirco-Ros-Car_VM/blob/main/ESP32-MicroROS-Car.jpg)
# Introduction
This ROS educational robot car migrates complex computing tasks to PC virtual machine environment, no need embedded development board (Jetson NANO/Raspberry Pi) as the main controller. The data and information generated by the car are remotely transmitted to the PC virtual machine system by the ESP32 co-processor through the WIFI UDP function of MicroROS, and complete the calculation and generate decisions. Yahboom provide 4PCS 310 encoder motor, 7.4V large-capacity battery, professional MicroROS control board, TOF lidar and other accessories, combined with the ROS2-Humble operating system and Python3 programming to help it achieve obstacle avoidance, following, and mapping navigation, RVIZ simulation, multi-machine synchronization control and other functions.
# Features
* It breaks away from the traditional Jetson NANO/Raspberry Pi development board and uses a virtual machine as the controller to reduce costs.
* The MicroROS control board has a built-in ESP32, which uses the WIFI UDP function of MicroROS to realize remote communication between the car and the PC virtual machine.
* Adopt ROS2-Humble operating system and Python3 programming, and provides a large number of courses and source codes for user reference.
* Lidar obstacle avoidance, following, mappingnavigation, RVIZ simulation, multi-machine synchronization control, APP/handle remote control and other functions are all supported.
* The body is made of aluminum alloy, equipped with a 310encoder motor and a 7.4V large-capacity battery, with beautiful appearance and excellent quality.
